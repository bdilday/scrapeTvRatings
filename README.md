scrapeTvRatings
===============

This code scrapes TV ratings data from the web. It was originally written to compare world series ratings across years, so it flags the data as "baseball", "football", or "other". If you run it, it will locally store about 1 GB of html files and output a csv file of about 8.7 MB.

The data, through March 2014, can be directly downloaded from Dropbox: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/yuleoyx326msrm9/scrapeTvRatings_0.csv.gz>
